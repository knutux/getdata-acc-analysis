# A script which
#  - looks for data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S
#    smartphone (it must be located in "UCI HAR Dataset" directory, which is
#    created in current working directory )
#  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
#  - Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
#  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
#  - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
#    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
