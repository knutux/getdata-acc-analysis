Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer data analysis
==================

Assignment description
------------------

Assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

Project contains a single script `run_analysis.R` which:
* Looks for data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone (it must be located in "UCI HAR Dataset" directory, which is created in current working directory )
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
* Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
